# Walkthrough
- *data_creation.py*

  The file that has functions for turning the images into a useable format and 
  for exporting and importing data sets. It turns images into arrays with a way
  of using either grayscale or colored images. The functions for exporting and
  importing sets relies on pickle to do so. This was taken from Cristian's
  [Fruit Image Recognition Project.](https://github.com/cmluna2913/FruitImageRecognition)
- *creating_data.py*

  This file shows the steps of using the functions to create the data from the
  directory where the images are stored. It also contains steps on how to use
  the other functions on how to export and import data using the pickle files.
  There are examples of how the images look by using the generated arrays to do
  so.
